Q.What is JSON
ANS. The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand

JSON Example

{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}
